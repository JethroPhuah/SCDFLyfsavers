## Introduction

Incorporating IoT and APIs, RoboHydrant aims to replace manual checks of all fire hydrants in Singapore.

## Features

## Automated Opening / Closing of Pressure Valve

The opening of the hydrant's valve usually involves manual turning of the knob on the ground. This process can be automated by the robotic hardware which uses supplied power upon receiving a request from the server. Likewise, after the static pressure is collected, the valve can be closed in the same automated process.

## Use of Geolocational API

The appplication incorporates Geolocational API and the coordinates of the coordinates of the hydrants to track the pressures of each hydrant at each location.
